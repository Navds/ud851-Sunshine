# Sunshine!

This is the repository for the weather app that students build during the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course at Udacity.

When you're done, or if you run into any problems, you can open up the solution code in another Android Studio window, and compare our solution to what you've written!

# Contributing

Because of the way this repository is constructed, pull requests don't really work. Issues, however, are gratefully accepted!
